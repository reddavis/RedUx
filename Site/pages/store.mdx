# Store

The store's job is to bring all the pieces together and provide an interface for us to send [events]() to.

## Setup

Here is a simple example of how the store could look. Similar to the envionment, it's recommended to have `main` and `mock` versions of your store. Having a mock version will make it super easy to manage your SwiftUI previews and snapshot tests.

```swift
import RedUx

typealias AppStore = Store<AppState, AppEvent, AppEnvironment>

extension AppStore {
    static func main(
        state: AppState = .init(),
        reducer: Reducer<State, Event, Environment> = AppReducer.main,
        environment: AppEnvironment = .main()
    ) -> AppStore {
        Store(
            state: state,
            reducer: reducer,
            environment: environment
        )
    }
    
    static func mock(
        state: AppState = .init(),
        environment: AppEnvironment = .mock()
    ) -> AppStore {
        Store(
            state: state,
            reducer: .empty,
            environment: environment
        )
    }
}
```

## Sending events

The only way to mutate the state is by sending [events](./events) which get passed to the reducer, which then mutates the state.

Events are sent to the store. 

```swift
store.send(.login)
```

The store will then process the event and update the state. It will also process any [effects](./effects) produced by the reducer.

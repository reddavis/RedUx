# Environment

The environment is used to hold things such as API clients, data stores and utility objects. It is then passed through to the reducer.

For example, our Twitter app could have an environment that looked like this:

```swift
struct AppEnvironment {
    static func make(
        apiClient: TwitterAPIClient = .main()
    ) -> Self {
        .init(
            apiClient: apiClient
        )
    }

    #if DEBUG
    static func mock(
        apiClient: TwitterAPIClient = .mock()
    ) -> Self {
        .init(
            apiClient: apiClient
        )
    }
    #endif

    // Internal
    let apiClient: TwitterAPIClient
}
```

It's good practice to have a mocked version of your environment and any objects it holds. This will make testing a breeze.

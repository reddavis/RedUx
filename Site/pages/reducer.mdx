# Reducer

A reducer is a function that is passed the current state, an event and the environment and can return an optional [effect](./effects). The reducer's role is to act upon (or not) the event.

The reducer should be as performant as possible, any long running task should performed by an [effect](./effects). 

These are the events from our example Twitter app.

```swift
enum AppEvent {
    case viewDidAppear

    case fetchTimeline
    case didFetchTimeline([Tweet])
    case failedFetchingTimeline(Error)
}
```

and this is the state:

```swift
struct AppState {
    var timeline: [Tweet] = []
    var followers: [User] = []
    var following: [User] = []
}

extension AppState: Equatable {}
```

Focussing on the timeline events, the plan here is that `fetchTimeline` will trigger an API request and then on success or fail the events `didFetchTimeline` or `failedFetchingTimeline` will be called. On `didFetchTimeline` the reducer will update the states `timeline` value.

```swift
let reducer: Reducer<AppState, AppEvent, AppEnvironment> = Reducer { state, event, environment in
    switch event {
    case .fetchTimeline:
        return Effect {
            do {
                let tweets = try await environment.apiClient.fetchTweets()
                return .didFetchTimeline(tweets)
            } catch {
                return .failedFetchingTimeline(error)
            }
        }
    case .didFetchTimeline(let tweets):
        state.timeline = tweets
        return .none
    case .failedFetchingTimeline(let error):
        // Do something with the error...
        return .none
    }
}
```
